# .ase to .sketchpalette

A small in-browser utility to convert Adobe .ase files into the .sketchpalette format is used in the [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes) plugin. Could possibly eventually be rolled into that plugin. _Note: It works, but is pretty hacky. Your mileage may vary._
